# Game of Life Remake with SDL2 and C++

This project is a remake of the classic "Game of Life," originally created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game demonstrates cellular automaton behavior in a grid-based environment. In this remake, SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2) is used along with C++ to create an interactive version of the Game of Life.

## How to Play

The Game of Life is not a traditional game with players and goals. Instead, it's a simulation of cellular automaton, where cells in a grid evolve over generations following certain rules. You can interact with the simulation by toggling cells on and off before or during the simulation.

Click on cells you want to activate and then prace space for the next generation to appear.
